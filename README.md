# Usage
## As this is RPN(reverse polish notation) calculator, you should type in only RPN arithmetic expressions
## Here are some examples:
* ### 3 4 + 5 * -> ((3+4)*5) -> should give the the result of 35
*  ### 2 7 + 5 6 + * -> (2+7)*(5+6) -> should give the the result of 99
*  ### 5 2 - 2 * -> (5-2)*2 -> should give the the result of 6

*this calculator is not perfect, like at all, so if you encounter bug, either notify in the issues or just ignore it:)
